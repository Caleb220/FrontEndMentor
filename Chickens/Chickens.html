            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a> subspecies of the red junglefowl,
            with
            attributes of
            wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
            cock
            is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
            castrated is
            a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pulled.

            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).<sup><a href="http://www.Google.com">[2]</a>[3]</sup> Humans now
            keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>

            <p>'Chicken' was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to
                its
                usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
                especially
                in
                American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl'
                or
                'domestic fowl'.[22]</p>
